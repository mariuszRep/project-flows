Protected Files and Directories:
- DO NOT create, modify, or delete any files in these locations under any circumstances.
- These files may be read and analyzed to understand the codebase.

General Guidelines
- Do not change anthing you have not been specificly asked to by the user.
- Check for Existing Logic:
- Verify if similar logic already exists before creating new components. If any uncertainty arises, ask the user for clarification.

Request Permission:
- Do not modify or adjust any components unless you have explicit permission. In cases of ambiguity, stop and ask for the user's direction before - proceeding.

Notify and Confirm Changes:
- If you remove or alter any logic, immediately inform the user, provide a summary of the modifications, and ask for their confirmation that the -changes meet their expectations.

Styling Guidelines
- Utilize Tailwind CSS:
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling. If a class is defined in index.css, reference that class instead of using direct Tailwind classes. If unsure, consult with the user.

Standardization with Tailwind:
- Use standardized Tailwind CSS classes consistently across all components. Always confirm with the user if the standard does not align with their expectations.

Color and Font Consistency:
- Define color variables and use them uniformly. Ensure a single font is applied across the entire application. Confirm these choices with the user if any conflicts arise.

Protected Components and Files:
- Do not modify components in the @src/components/ui directory or any other protected components. Similarly, do not alter files like @src/index.css or @tailwind.config.ts without obtaining explicit user permission. For any uncertainty, ask the user before proceeding.
